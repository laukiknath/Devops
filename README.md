# DevOps Practicals

This repository contains all my **DevOps-related practicals** completed as part of my college academic curriculum.  
It serves as a collection of hands-on exercises and implementations covering various DevOps concepts, tools, and workflows.

## 📌 Overview
During my academic learning, I have worked on multiple DevOps practicals to strengthen my understanding of automation, deployment, and CI/CD processes.  
This repository is a structured record of those practicals for reference, revision, and demonstration.
